## Local Development

In order to fetch data from the Drupal instance, Next.js needs to know the endpoint
at build time. For local development, the starter kit uses [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

When you clone your decoupled frontend repo, create a `.env.development.local` file.
In this file, update the `BACKEND_URL` and `IMAGE_DOMAIN` with your Drupal CMS URL, and the `IMAGE_DOMAIN`.

For example:

```
BACKEND_URL=https://my-drupal-site.pantheon.site/
IMAGE_DOMAIN=my-drupal-site.pantheon.site
```

If your site is translated and you would like the hreflang metadata set correctly, 
you may set `FRONTEND_URL` to the URL of your frontend site:

```
FRONTEND_URL=https://my-frontend-site.pantheon.site
```

For development, this value can be set to any string, or `http://localhost:3000`

## Decoupled Preview

To enable Decoupled Preview, the following environment variables must be set
in the `.env.development.local` for local dev and in the Pantheon dashboard for production or
Multdev environments.

```
PREVIEW_SECRET
CLIENT_ID
CLIENT_SECRET
```

- PREVIEW_SECRET - Set the Preview Secret here: {your Backend URL}/admin/structure/dp-preview-site/example_nextjs_preview
- CLIENT_ID - Visable as the UUID for the “Example Consumer” here: {your Backend URL}/en/admin/config/services/consumer
- CLIENT_SECRET - Set the Client Secret here: {your Backend URL}/admin/config/services/consumer/2/edit

## Multi-Dev

In the Pantheon Dashboard, link your CMS site to your decoupled site. This will allow you
to skip setting the `BACKEND_URL` and `IMAGE_DOMAIN` in the dashboard.
You can override this behavior by setting the values as usual.

The environment variables for Decoupled Preview and `FRONTEND_URL` must
be set via the dashboard.

If for some reason you are unable to link your CMS site through the dashboard,
the `BACKEND_URL` and `IMAGE_DOMAIN` can be set manually in the **Build** section of the dashboard.
