## Before You Begin

This guide assumes the reader has working knowledge of [React](https://reactjs.org/), and little to no knowledge of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Data Fetching in Next.js

Next.js offers various ways to fetch data and render content. Please see the Next.js [Data Fetching Overview](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview) for an in depth look at each.
For the purposes of this guide, we will cover creating a page with [Server Side Rendering (SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) and [Static Site Generation (SSG)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended).

### Fetching Drupal Content with DrupalState

The `next-drupal-starter` has a dependency on `@pantheon-systems/drupal-kit`, which implements [Drupal State](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/drupal_state/en/introduction/) - a tool that helps fetch and store data from Drupal into the local app state.

### SSR Example

To render a page with Server Side Rendering (SSR) in Next.js, export an async function called [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) from that page. Inside of this function, we can use Drupal State to fetch data from Drupal and pass it to the component as props.

```jsx title=pages/articles/index.js
import { DrupalState } from "@pantheon-systems/drupal-kit";

export default function Articles({ articles }) {
  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(articles, null, 4)}</pre>;
}

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { locale } = context; // use the current locale in order to fetch correct translation

  const store = new DrupalState({
    apiBase: process.env.BACKEND_URL,
    defaultLocale: locale,
  });

  const articles = await store.getObject({
    objectName: "node--article",
    // Drupal State allows us to use a graphql query to get the data we need and nothing extra
    query: `
      {
        title
        body
        created
        path {
          alias
        }
      }
    `,
  });

  return {
    props: {
      articles,
    },
  };
}
```

### SSG Example

If we want to use SSG, export [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) from a page to generate that page at _build_ time instead of _request_ time.

Let's build a page using `getStaticProps` that lists recipes from our Drupal instance.

```jsx title=pages/recipes/index.js
import { DrupalState } from "@pantheon-systems/drupal-kit";

export default function Recipes({ recipes }) {
  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(recipes, null, 4)}</pre>;
}

export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const { locale } = context; // use the current locale in order to fetch correct translation

  const store = new DrupalState({
    apiBase: process.env.BACKEND_URL,
    defaultLocale: locale,
  });

  const recipes = await store.getObject({
    objectName: "node--recipe",
    query: `
      {
        title
        field_ingredients
        field_number_of_servings
        field_preperation_time
        field_recipe_instruction
        field_summary
        created
        path {
          alias
        }
      }
    `,
  });

  return {
    props: {
      recipes,
    },
  };
}
```

Notice the only real difference for this page - besides the fact we are fetching recipes instead of articles - is the use of `getStaticProps` instead of `getServerSideProps`.

## Next Steps

From here, it's time to see the code in action. Start the app if it's not already running and head to `http://localhost:3000/articles`. You should see the SSR'd `Articles` page.
Check `http://localhost:3000/recipes` to see the SSG'd `Recipies` page.

From this point, you may want to adjust the markup and style of the `Articles` and `Recipes` components, or move on to another custom page. For more information on composing react components, see [Composing Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#composing-components)

## Conclusion

In this guide we created a new page using SSR and SSG utilizing Drupal State to fetch data from our Drupal instance.
You now have what you need to create pages in Next.js with data sourced from Drupal!
