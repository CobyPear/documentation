Version compatibility issues can occur when packages pulled by Composer are updated along with their dependencies. You will need to manually alter the version constraints on a given package within the `require` or `require-dev` section of `composer.json` to update the packages if this happens. See the [updating dependencies](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#updating-dependencies-to-their-latest-versions) section of Composer's documentation for more information.

Troubleshoot package updates by running `composer update`. This updates `composer.lock` to the latest available packages. Package updates are constrained by version requirements in `composer.json`.
